## Eco-evolutionary theory | Life & Environmental Sciences 

<p>
  <span class="firstcharacter">W</span>
  e are a diverse group of ecologists and evolutionary biologists who investigate how nature works using a combination of theory, statistical approaches, and sometimes even data. The questions that we investigate range from understanding what rodents eat and why, to uncovering energetic thresholds constraining mammalian body size evolution, to predicting when crickets should lose their chirp, to exploring the effects of assembly and engineers on ecological communities, to predicting behavioral transitions among mammalian carnivores. While our interests are varied, we aim to apply simple models in mature ways to uncover the fundamental processes governing the dynamics of ecological and evolutionary systems in both the past and present.

<span style="font-size:2em;">Greetings</span> my name is Justin Yeakel and I am currently an Omidyar postdoctoral fellow at the [Santa Fe Institute](http://www.santafe.edu) in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
My wife and I moved to Santa Fe during the summer of 2014 after having spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Simon Fraser University with [Dr. Jon Moore](http://moorelab.wix.com/moorelab) studying the impact of watershed structure on the population dynamics of freshwater animals.
At the Santa Fe Institute, I am exploring how different spatial structures impact consumer-resource relationships, and how these constraints trickle-up to impact the structure of biological communities.
In addition, I am currently building theoretical models of niche evolution, as well as developing methods to inform models of niche use from stable isotopic data.
These different approachs are meant to inform our understanding of the underlying constraints driving resource-use at the individual, species, and community levels.
