<span style="font-size:2em;">Greetings</span> my name is Justin Yeakel and I am currently an Omidyar postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
My wife and I moved to Santa Fe during the summer of 2014 after having spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Simon Fraser University with Dr. Jon Moore studying the impact of watershed structure on the population dynamics of freshwater animals.
At the Santa Fe Institute, I am exploring how different spatial structures impact consumer-resource relationships, and how these constraints 'trickle--up' to impact the structure of biological communities.
In addition, I am currently building theoretical models of niche evolution, as well as developing methods to inform models of niche use from stable isotopic data.
These different approachs are meant to inform our understanding of the underlying constraints driving resource-use at the individual, species, and community levels.

I am a quantitative ecologist primarily interested in how trophic interactions between animals impact the structure and functioning of ecological communities.
My work does not focus on a model organism or ecosystem, but instead is aimed towards exploring general underlying processes that influence a wide variety of ecosystems.
Moreover, I have a deep interest in using paleontological and/or historical data to understand how biological systems change over longer timescales that are not accessible using traditional ecological approaches.
