We can depict communities of interacting species as networks, where the nodes of the network represent species (or perhaps guilds or functional groups), and the links of the network represent various types of interactions. These interactions range from trophic to mutualistic, parasitic, or commensalistic, among others. For much of the course, we have focused on understanding, interpreting, and analyzing small interaction *motifs*... one or two species linked by a single type of interaction. Motifs, when added together in their various forms, structure ecological networks. In this discussion section, we will confine ourselves to trophic networks, or *food webs*. In this case, each node will be a species, and each link will represent a flow of biomass from one species to another.

## Depictions of ecological networks

A network can be depicted a few ways, and we will explore two of them. The first is as described... where we draw a *network*, or *graph*, where nodes are connected by links. Look at the network below. You will see that there are 11 nodes, or species, in the community. Notice also that the links are in fact arrows. Here we are using the links to represent biomass flow. If the links have arrows, it is a *directed network* because the links are noting a direction. If the links do not have arrows, it is an *undirected network*. 



> ### Discussion
> 1. Who is eating whom in this food web? List out the resources consumed by each species
> 2. Sketch out a histogram of species' degrees. This is called a degree distribution. But wait... do you include *all* links? Consider species *D*. It has two incoming links, and one outgoing link. In network terminology, we say that species *D* has an *in-degree* of 2 and an *out-degree* of 1. When we draw the degree distribution we have choices... we could draw a degree distribution for *any* link (treating them as undirected), we could draw a degree distribution for just the *out-degree* links, or we could draw a degree distribution for just the *in-degree links. Try all three. Which degree distribution best captures the distribution of consumers in the community?
> 3. What does the in-degree distribution tell you?
> 4. What does the out-degree distribution tell you?

We can depict this network as a matrix as well, without losing any information. We do so by first building a square matrix, meaning that the matrix has as many rows as it has columns. We will build a matrix with as many rows and columns as there are species. The elements of a matrix represents feeding relationships. The way we fill this in is to a) walk along each column. For the the column that represents a given species, fill in the row for that accords with each species it eats. Check out the simple examples below:

> ### Discussion
> 1. Practice drawing the interaction matrix for each of the small food web motifs. Do you get the same answer?
> 2. Note that we are making a distinction between links flowing *in* and links flowing *out*. The above two examples show interaction matrices for incoming links... in other words we are filling in the resources for each consumer. We could also build an interaction matrix for the outflowing links... in that case we would be filling in the consumers for each resource. What would this matrix look like? Would it be the same or different?
> 3. Draw the corresponding interaction matrix for the more complex network shown at the top of the section (for species *A-K*).


## Analyzing an empirical interaction network
Now let's examine an *actual* food web! We will be using a famous marine food web based on observations made off the coast of Namibia in the Benguelan Sea. See [this link for the original paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/177149?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) that described the interactions within this famous system. Use the code below to visualize the interaction matrix.

> ### Discussion
> 1. How many species are in the system?
> 2. Note that this interaction is for the incoming links for each species... in other words, we are tracking the flow of biomass from prey to predators. Build a degree distribution for these species. What does the degree distribution tell you?
> 3. You wouldn't know otherwise, but the species in the system are ordered from smallest to largest. The smallest species are the top-left row/column; the largest species are towards the right-bottom. Given this information, what ecological insights can you gain by looking at this system?

Now let's use the same data to build a network. 


```R
    library(NetIndices)
    library(igraph)
    # Input the data as a vector
    mvec = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

I've made a few choices here in terms of visualization. First, I've scaled where the species are drawn along the y-axis to their trophic level. So lower trophic level species are placed near the bottom and higher trophic level species are placed as we move from the bottom to the top.

> ### Discussion
> 1. What is easier to get information from? The matrix depiction or the network depiction?
> 2. Given that we have stated that smaller-bodied species are on the left/top of the matrix, and larger-bodied species are to the right/bottom, what can we say about how body size relates to trophic level by looking at the network?
> 3. Sharks are species 29. What can you say about them? 


Use this code to identify which species correlate to the number IDs in the network and interaction matrix. 

```R
    spnames = c('Phytoplankton', 'Benthic Filter-feeders', 'Bacteria', 'Benthic Carnivores', 'Microzoo', 'mesozoo', 'Macrozoo', 'Gelatinous zoo', 'Anchovy', 'Pilchard', 'Round Herring', 'Lightfish', 'Lanternfish', 'goby', 'Other Pleagics', 'Horse mackerel', 'Chub mackerel', 'Other Groundfish', 'Hake', 'squid', 'tunas', 'snoek', 'kob', 'yellowtail', 'feelbeck', 'cetaceans', 'birds', 'seals', 'sharks')
    spids = seq(1,29)
    
    d = cbind(spids,spnames)
    print(d)
```
