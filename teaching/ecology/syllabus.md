    Everything that we do this this course will revolve around two principle websites. In some cases, information will be duplicated on both sites (link to readings), and I will attempt to cross-link as necessary.
    > The [***CatCourse Website (Canvas)***](https://catcourses.ucmerced.edu/): Turning in assignments, grades, lectures, links to readings

+ **Course Description**  

    This course fulfills an upper division requirement for the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) emphasis track of the Biological Sciences Major, as well an upper division requirement for the Earth Systems Science Major. This course provides an introduction to ecology - the scientific study of how organisms interact with each other and their physical environment. Prerequisite: BIO 001 or BIO 005 or ESS 001 or ESS 005 or consent of instructor. Normal Letter Grade only.
<br>  
+ **Course Goals & Outcomes**  
    * ***Goals***
        * Learn key concepts and major topics in ecology, including: how organisms interact with their environment; the dynamics and regulation of populations; the various types and character of the interactions among organisms; the nature, geography, and biodiversity of communities; the structure and function of ecosystems; and applied and large-scale ecological topics, such as conservation biology, landscape ecology and ecosystem management, and global change
        * Understand the linkages between ecology and the other subfields of the biological sciences and earth systems science
        * Understand the fundamentals of the methods used in ecological research
        * Appreciation for the positive and negative impacts of humans on ecological systems
        * Be able to communicate ecological knowledge to other scientists and laypersons, and apply basic concepts to comprehend and evaluate science in the popular press and in the primary scientific literature
    * ***Outcomes*** At the end of the course, students should be able to:
        * Explain the fundamental ecological principles that pertain to individual organisms, to populations, to communities, to ecosystems, to landscapes, and to the globe
        * Develop a broad appreciation of the linkages among ecology, evolution, and earth systems science
        * Describe and understand the various techniques used in ecology, from computation to experimental, and how these techniques are coupled with the scientific method to address ecological questions
        * Comprehend the practical applications of ecological principles in human society and the potential impacts of humans on ecological systems
        * Critically evaluate the scientific literature as well as the popular press, and take ownership of the course material to improve their functioning in society

+ **Format & Procedures**  
    
    This course is structured as follows: two 165-minute lecture sessions and one 110-minute discussion section per week. Discussion sections will provide students an opportunity to discuss in more detail scientific findings from peer-reviewed publications and practice using the R programming langauge to confront ecological problems. Your participation in lectures and discussion sections is mandatory.  
<!-- 
    We will also spend a Saturday morning in March exploring the Vernal Pools ecosystem just off campus to apply some of our newly gained ecological knowledge to the field. All students are required to attend and participate. Field observations from the Vernal Pools will be used to write a Field Report towards the end of the semester. -->


+ **Course Requirements & Grading Procedures**  
    * ***Class Attendance and Participation Policy***  
        * This course is delivered ***synchronously over ZOOM*** The lecture & discussion attendance *at the time of the lecture & discussion* is required.
        * Attendance and participation in the discussion section is required and will be a component of the student’s course grade.  
        * The **2** lowest lecture attendance scores will be dropped  
    * ***Required and Supplemental Readings***  
        * **Required Textbook**: W.D. Bowman, S.D. Hacker, and Cain, M.L. 2017. Ecology, 4th or 5th Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Publishers. Sunderland, MA.  
        * Everyone is given ebook access (and charged) at the beginning of the course (see announcement on CatCourses for more info). If you do not wish to maintain your access to the ebook, follow the instructions on the CatCourses announcement to decline access and recoup the ebook charge.    
        * Readings will also be assigned for the Discussion section and instead of the book for some lectures. These are required and will be provided on the course website.  
        * Note: earlier editions (1st, 2nd, 3rd) of this textbook may be used but are not recommended.  
    * ***In-class laptops or tablets***
        * Each student will be expected to have access to a laptop or tablet during lectures and discussion sections to explore ecological models. Any operating system will suffice, as will iPads or similar tablet-like devices. Smartphones are ***not*** recommended.  
    * ***Course Assignments and Projects***  
        * **Homework**: Throughout the semester,  homework assignments will be assigned, consisting of exercises provided by the Teaching Assistant/Instructor. ***Homework assignments will be delivered via Canvas***  
        <!-- * **Quizzes**: Quizzes will be given periodically during the lecture period. They will not necessarily be announced. -->  
        * **Discussion Activities**: All students are required to go to their respective Discussion Sections and participate/engage in the discussions and activities conducted in the section. Your discussion grade will take into account both participation and responses to Discussion assignments. ***Only otherwise notified, Discussion Activity scores will be delivered via CatCourses***   
        * **Exams**: There will be **2** “midterm” exams during the semester and **1** comprehensive final. There will be no make-up exams or early exams. If you are sick during an exam, you must supply a note from your doctor verifying your illness. Your grade for the missed exam will be based on your average score from the other exams. You cannot miss more than one exam for an excused illness and taking the final is mandatory in order to pass the course. ***Exams may either be in person or delivered remotely via Canvas, as the situation requires***
        * ***Grading***: Your final grade will be based on the following: lecture attendance: 5%; discussion section participation & activities: 15%; homework: 15%; midterms: 40% (two, 20% each); and comprehensive final exam: 25%.  
        * Grades will be given using the approximate framework: A: 90 - 100%, B: 80 - 90%, C: 70 - 80%, D: 60 - 70%, F: < 60%. This framework is subject to change given the distribution of the final grades.   
        * Late assignments (e.g., homework) will not be accepted.
