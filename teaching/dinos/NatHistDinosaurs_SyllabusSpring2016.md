> Become familiar with Earth history and the history of life through the
> lens of the origin and dominance of Dinosauria during the Mesozoic Era
> (252-66 million years ago). This will include a detailed understanding
> of the relationships between dinosaur taxa, their known ecological
> niches, and the clues by which paleontologists reconstruct these
> animals and their environment.
>
> 1\. This course is structured as follows: 3 50-minute lecture session
> with me and one 50 minute discussion/practical section with the TA per
> week.
>
> 2\. Discussion sections will provide students an opportunity to discuss
> in more detail concepts introduced in class, practical sessions on
> graphing, reading scientific papers, data collection, and review for
> exams. *Your participation in discussion section is required and is part
> of your grade* (see Grading below).
>
> Students are expected to attend all lectures; and will sign in for
> attendance. It has been shown that a student’s performance in a course
> is ****closely**** coupled to their attendance. *Attendance and
> participation in the discussion section is ***required*** and will be
> a component of the student’s course grade (see Discussion syllabus for
> details).*
>
> ***Students are required to have a *bound notebook* (not an iPad or
> other electronic device) for taking notes during lectures.***
>
> Required Textbook: *Fastovsky & Weishampel. Dinosaurs: A Concise
> Natural History, 2nd edition*.
>
> Selections from: *Brusatte, S. Dinosaur Paleobiology.* (provided)
>
> Course Website: http://jdyeakel.github.io/teaching/dinos/
>
> Information, lectures, notes, and important dates/alerts related to
> the course will be posted here.
>
> ***LEARNING WILL BE ASSESSED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER:***
>
> *Assignments (e.g., homework, natural history report) should be handed
> in on time. *
>
> *Late assignments will lose a letter grade (10%) each day past the due
> date.*
>
> **Homework:** Homework will be assigned by the Teaching Assistant. The
> assignments will include problem sets, reading, and writing and will
> be directly related to material presented in class, for which students
> may expect to see on an exam. Some assignments will be based on
> readings from the primary literature.
>
> **Natural History Report:** Each student will choose a topic of
> interest concerning the natural history of dinosaurs and write a **1/2
> page abstract** of their chosen topic. This abstract will serve as one
> of the above homework assignments and requires approval from the
> instructor. Pending approval of this summary statement, each student
> will then write a **6-page research report** (no more, no less) on
> their chosen topic.
>
> **Quizzes:** ***4 quizzes*** will be given periodically during the
> lecture period. They will be announced during class.
>
> **Exams:** There will be three “midterm” exams during the semester and
> a final. If you are sick during an exam, please bring a note from your
> doctor verifying your illness. Missed exams based on an excused
> medical illness will be taken as soon as possible. ***There will be no
> early exams given. ***
>
> Letter Grading Scale: A: (90-100%); B: (75-90%); C: (65-75%), D:
> (50-60%), F: (\<50%)
>
> **Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:** The University of
> California Merced is committed to ensuring equal academic
> opportunities and inclusion for students with disabilities based on
> the principles of independent living, accessible universal design and
> diversity. I am available to discuss appropriate academic
> accommodations required for student with disabilities. Requests for
> academic accommodations are to be made during the first 3 weeks of the
> semester, except for unusual circumstances. Students are encouraged to
> register with Disability Services Center to verify their eligibility
> for appropriate accommodations. The instructor will make every effort
> to accommodate all students who, because of religious obligations,
> have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments, or required
> attendance. Please speak with the instructor during the 1st week of
> class regarding any potential academic.

**Tentative Weekly Schedule**: Please note that the Instructor reserves
