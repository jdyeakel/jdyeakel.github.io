## Welcome!
Welcome to the course website for ***Advanced Topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology***. Of course, this semester we will be running this course entirely remotely, with both lecture and discussion section occurring on ZOOM (links below). This course will be conducted ***synchronously***, meaning that it is mandatory that you attend lectures and discussions *at the times they occur*.
