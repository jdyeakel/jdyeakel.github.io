## Welcome!
Welcome to the course website for ***Advanced Topics in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology***. If all goes to plan, we will be meeting in person this year, though the first class will be via ZOOM (link below). On this site, you will find all materials and links for the course. See Syllabus an Schedule for details (link below). Assignments will be turned in via *Canvas*.

### Prior to our class meetings:
+ * Critically read the reading assignment!
+ * Contribute 3 questions to the relevant [docx file on Box](). Make sure you are logged into Box to edit.  
+ * Are you the Discussion lead? If so, **write and submit via Canvas** an outline describing:
    * Necessary background context and definitions
    * Explanation of key figures
    * Connection of the topic to Systems themes:
      * Whether the (and which) conclusions depend on the empirical/ experimental/ observational/ computational investigation of biological systems across multiple scales of organization.  
      * The ways in which data related to the topic capture emergent properties of populations and networks.
