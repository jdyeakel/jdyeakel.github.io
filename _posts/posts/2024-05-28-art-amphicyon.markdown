  rying to stay a little more on top of anatomy on this one. There are quite a few known species of <i>Amphicyon</i> (Miocene), spanning Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. But to me it will always be the 'lion-weasel'. I started this last summer, but was consumed with my new role as bio program chair... now have a little break between my spring <i>Dinosaurs</i> course and my summer <i>Ecology</i> course, so it's been fun to jump back into this. Maybe next up should be some herbivores, as I find them a bit more interesting anatomically.
