This one was a challenge, and there's parts of it I like and parts that I don't. With some creative liberties, this artiodactyl is thought to have been the largest terrestrial mammalian carnivore, topping the scales at roughly 1000 Kg! We explore how the energetic requirements of carnivores this large would crash herbivore populations if contemporary predator-prey mass relationships are followed (predato-prey mass relationships document the expected prey mass for a given predator mass, or sometimes the expected predator mass for a given prey mass). We explore these ideas in a paper that's currently in revision in *American Naturalist*. You can find the ArXived version [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16638){:target="_blank"}.
