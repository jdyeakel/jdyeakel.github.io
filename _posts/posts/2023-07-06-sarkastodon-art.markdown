Here's a wild (and loose) interpretation of the 500-800 Kg oxyaenodont *Sarkastodon*, an extinct placental mammalian carnivore (within the paraphyletic Creodonta). There doesn't seem to be much known about this group, and most reconstructions I've seen are very giant-weasel-like. This is obviously more cat-like with weird mandrill shit going on on its face. Incorporated the spread digits, blunt canines, and large masticatory build - crunching bones wouldn't seem to be much of an issue. But a lot of artistic license on some pretty partial fossils, so why not go wild?
