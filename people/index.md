<!---
Our group is generally interested in the physical and biological constraints that shape trophic interactions, and how changes in these interactions impact community dynamics over both ecological and evolutionary time. 
We employ both theoretical as well as empirical approaches to address many different aspects of problems that fall within this central focus, including but not limited to:   

* Nonlinear dynamics   
* Stochastic processes   
* Dynamic programming   
* Stable isotopes   
* Historical records
* Paleontological data   



I generally use network-theoretic approaches – combined with empirical measures of interactions e.g. stable isotopic data – to try to understand how species interactions trickle up to impact the structure and functioning of ecological communities. My long-term interests fall into 3 core themes:

* the proximate drivers and ultimate effects of species interactions
* the effects of large-scale (spatial and temporal) factors on community assembly and dis-assembly
* the interplay between landscape structure and population/community dynamics

###Background

I graduated in 2004 from Kent State University in Ohio (my home state) with a degree in Biological Anthropology, a minor in biology, and specializing in outdoor education (I spent two years working at LongAcre Expeditions, and am a graduate of the NOLS Alaska summer course).
After reading Chaos by James Glieck in 2003, and his beautiful descriptions of the Santa Cruz campus, I sent a random email to [Paul Koch](http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/), a professor at UCSC specializing in using stable isotopes to study modern and paleo ecosystems.
He ended up offering me a job in the mass spec facility at UCSC, where I worked for two years before becoming a graduate student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.   
<br>
While at UCSC, I began working with [Nate Dominy](https://biology.dartmouth.edu/people/nathaniel-j-dominy) in the Anthropology Department and ended up spending 3 field seasons all over sub-Saharan Africa studying mole rats, forest canopies, and fur seals, among other things.
During the latter half of my Ph.D., I began working with [Marc Mangel](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~msmangel/) using quantitative approaches to study dietary behaviors and the compensatory dynamics of fish recruitment, finishing my degree in 2012.     
<br>
From 2012-2014, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Simon Fraser University working with Jon Moore on the metapopulation dynamics of aquatic species - specifically those constrained to river watersheds.
I had a great time learning about the insane life-history of salmon, and got to spend a lot of time with people who know those systems inside and out, including [Jon](http://moorelab.wix.com/moorelab), [Mike Beakes](http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=vB5kMZoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Corey Phillis](http://coreyphillis.github.io), and [Sean Anderson](http://seananderson.ca). 
Not being a specialist in any one system, it was a humbling and exciting experience!   
<br>
As of June, 2014 I began as an Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico. SFI has no boundaries between disciplines, and I feel lucky to work alongside so many excellent people spanning so many subject areas.
