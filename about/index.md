## Interests

I am interested in the physical and biological constraints that shape trophic interactions, and how changes in these interactions impact community dynamics over evolutionary time. I generally use network-theoretic approaches – combined with empirical measures of interactions e.g. stable isotopic data – to try to understand how species interactions trickle up to impact the structure and functioning of ecological communities. My long-term interests fall into 3 core themes:

* the proximate drivers and ultimate effects of species interactions
* the effects of large-scale (spatial and temporal) factors on community assembly and dis-assembly
* the interplay between landscape structure and population/community dynamics

###Background

I graduated in 2004 from Kent State University in Ohio (my home state) with a degree in Biological Anthropology, a minor in biology, and specializing in outdoor education (I spent two years working at LongAcre Expeditions, and am a graduate of the NOLS Alaska summer course).
After reading Chaos by James Glieck in 2003, and his beautiful descriptions of the Santa Cruz campus, I sent a random email to [Paul Koch](http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/), a professor at UCSC specializing in using stable isotopes to study modern and paleo ecosystems.
He ended up offering me a job in the mass spec facility at UCSC, where I worked for two years before becoming a graduate student in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.


While at UCSC, I began working with [Nate Dominy](https://biology.dartmouth.edu/people/nathaniel-j-dominy) in the Anthropology Department and ended up spending 3 field seasons all over sub-Saharan Africa studying mole rats, forest canopies, and fur seals, among other things.
During the latter half of my Ph.D., I began working with [Marc Mangel](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~msmangel/) using quantitative approaches to study dietary behaviors and the compensatory dynamics of fish recruitment, finishing my degree in 2012.  


From 2012-2014, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Simon Fraser University working with Jon Moore on the metapopulation dynamics of aquatic species - specifically those constrained to river watersheds.
I had a great time learning about the insane life-history of salmon, and got to spend a lot of time with people who know those systems inside and out, including [Jon](http://moorelab.wix.com/moorelab), [Mike Beakes](http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=vB5kMZoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Corey Phillis](http://coreyphillis.github.io), and [Sean Anderson](http://seananderson.ca). 
Not being a specialist in any one system, it was a humbling and exciting experience!

As of June, 2014 I began as an Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute in Santa Fe, New Mexico. SFI has no boundaries between disciplines, and I feel lucky to work alongside so many excellent people spanning so many subject areas.
