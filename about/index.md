## Interests

I am interested in the physical and biological constraints that shape trophic interactions, and how changes in these interactions impact community dynamics over evolutionary time. I generally use network-theoretic approaches – combined with empirical measures of interactions e.g. stable isotopic data – to try to understand how species interactions trickle up to impact the structure and functioning of ecological communities. My long-term interests fall into 3 core themes:

* the proximate drivers and ultimate effects of species interactions
* the effects of large-scale (spatial and temporal) factors on community assembly and dis-assembly
* the interplay between landscape structure and population/community dynamics
